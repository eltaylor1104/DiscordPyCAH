# Cards Against Humanity

We have developed a unique, state-of-the-art system that allows for a seamless game of Cards Against Humanity all through Discord DMs and a leaderboard in the channel where the command is executed. To start a game, simply type `c!start`, assuming your prefix is `c!`. It's that easy! Players react to the start message to join the game, and once the game is started, the prompt will be shown, and players will select a card through their DMs. The "Card Genie" will then select their favorite card, or all participants will vote if Vote Mode is enabled. That's it! If a user is being troublesome, you may use `c!cahkick @bonfire#6969`, assuming their username is **bonfire#6969**. If you wish to end the game early, simply run `c!end` and the game will be ended. You can support the bot on Patreon [here.](discord.gg) 



# Moderation

We have an extremely large amount of Moderation commands through our bot. All integrate seamlessly throughout Discord Permissions and Audit Logs. The commands are as follows:

- `c!ban` : Bans the metioned user, or provided ID
- `c!kick` : Kicks the user provided with either a mention or ID
- `c!unban` : Unbans the user provided in a split format, ie. `c!unban bonfire#6969`
- `c!addrole @bonfire#6969 @Epic CAH Player` : Adds the mentioned role to the mentioned User.
- `c!removerole @bonfire#6969 @Muted` : Removes the mentioned role from the mentioned user.
