TO DO



1. Stop having bot send messages when it adds it's own reactions
2. figure out the thing at the top that send "FUCK OFF" anytime anyone adds a reactions
3. start assigning tasks and getting cards
4. figure out how to store users that are playing, but also allow it so that sepereate games could be going on in different servers.
